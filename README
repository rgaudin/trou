trou is a command-line tool for piping some content to your pasteboard.
Basically, it copies everything from stdin to the pasteboard.
And it does it well.

WARNING: the OSX and linux versions are COMPLETLY different.
The OSX version won't work on Linux.
The Linux version uses Gtk and  so won't work on non-gtk systems.

Example:
$ cat somefile | trou
